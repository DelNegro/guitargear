# Building the ultimate database of guitarist and the gear they use (ABAB RAP STYLE)
## Motivation
Starting to learn the ABAO RESTful Application Model I was searching for a new "project" in my free time to learn AABP RAP. SFLIGHT and the Enterprise Procurement Model are well known, but as I was searching for something new to deepen my knowledge in this area. I like playing on my guitars, so why don't bbuild a ABAP RESTful Application on SAP Cloud Platform with the goal to catalog every piece of equipment in the greatest guitar rigs.
